High Level Description:

Modify the click modular router without fussing with magi and magi agents.
Make the experience easier and have a better user experience.


Details:

The main module is modify_click.py.  It is a wrapper around the aptly named
wrapper.py and py2_wrapper.py.  modify_click.py only checks which version
of python is calling it.  It will call py2_wrapper.py if being called by
python version 2.x or wrapper.py for python 3.x.

The code should be run on an isi.deterlab.net host, specifically one that
mounts the users filesystem, and has access to the control host for an
experiment.

More details:

Based on the inputs given by the user, the code configures a dictionary with
['msg', 'element', 'key', 'value'] keys.  These keys are required by the
clickAgent magi module (edgect/magi_modules).  Modifications were made to
clickControl.py to verify if the correct click modules were entered. Replies
are sent to /var/log/magi/daemon.log.  These logs are checked when a user
uses the \h (help) input to parse through what available click elements, or
keys are valid.  This command requires that a bogus aal is generated and run
through click in order to generate a log message.



The code base:

modify_click.py
 | - wrapper.py
 | - py2_wrapper.py
requirements.txt
click_template.aal
file_input_example.txt
__init__.py

Do not modify click_template.aal file.  Okay to modify file_input_example.txt
